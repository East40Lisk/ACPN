# RFC-0001: Autonomous Content Protection Network (ACPN)

Status: Draft  
Category: Standards Track  

## Abstract
ACPN defines a cryptographically enforced execution-control framework for digital content, decoupling storage permanence from execution authority.

Execution is permitted only when cryptographic conditions are satisfied.

## Core Invariant

Execution MUST be denied if any validation step fails.

## Execution Order (Normative)

1. Resolve ACPN DID
2. Verify signature binding
3. Enforce domain quorum
4. Verify Sealed Content Descriptor (SCD)
5. Verify zero-knowledge authorization (if present)
6. Check revocation
7. Allow execution

Failure at any step MUST result in denial.
